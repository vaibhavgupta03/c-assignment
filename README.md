# C Programming Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to various C programming assignments. The purpose of this folder is to practice and revise fundamental concepts in C programming, including data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.

## Folder Structure

- **assignment-1/**: Contains the first set of assignments.
  - **CST-501-LAB1.pdf**: The assignment document outlining the problems.
  - **qn1/**: Solution for question 1.
    - `qn1.c`: C source code.
    - `qn1.exe`: Compiled executable.
  - **qn2/**: Solution for question 2.
    - `qn2.c`: C source code.
    - `a.out`, `qn2.exe`, `qn2.i`, `qn2.o`, `qn2.s`: Compilation artifacts.
  - **qn3/**: Solution for question 3.
    - `qn3.c`: C source code.
  - **qn4/**: Solution for question 4.
    - `qn4.c`: C source code.
    - `qn4.exe`: Compiled executable.
  - **qn5/**: Solution for question 5.
    - `qn5.c`: C source code.
    - `qn5.exe`: Compiled executable.

## How to Run

To compile and run any C program, use the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output.exe
./output.exe
```

Replace `filename.c` with the actual C file name.

## Purpose

I am solving these coding problems and uploading the code to my GitHub repository to revise and practice C programming concepts. This helps in reinforcing learning and tracking progress over time.
